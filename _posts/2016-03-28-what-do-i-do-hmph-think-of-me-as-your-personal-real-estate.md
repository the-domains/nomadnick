What do I do. Hmph... Think of me as your personal Real Estate Problem Solver... All right? I am both a Realtor and a Real Estate Investor, so I'm in a very unique position to make sure that you make the right decisions when it comes to choosing, the right home and the right investment properties that are going to actually MAKE money for you, rather than costing you an arm and a leg, okay? Which is what the vast majority of people get themselves into by the way. To boil it all down, I really do three main things, okay?:

First, if you have a house that you want to sell, whether it's in perfect shape or whether needs a lot of work; whether you want to fix it up yourself or just get rid of it, I will get you the most amount of money for it, in the least amount of time - guaranteed! Okay? The stuff that I do, to get a home sold quickly, and for a lot of money, is, quite frankly) insane, and it's a heck of a lot more than what any other Realtor's gonna do for you out there, alright?

Secondly, I'm also a huge advocate of real estate investing (that's where I make a lot of my income from), and I can help you get started making money in real estate no matter where you're starting from! Okay? Even if you've got nothing. I've created a free program that I call the "HomeHunters Academy" that you're welcome to join today if you want (I'll give you an invitation) and you get started towards making some really good money in real estate, within even a week of joining, it doesn't have to take long at all. Okay?

And then thirdly, I help you buy the perfect properties. So whether you're looking for the perfect dream-home, a great deal on an investment property to either flip or hold onto long-term... or if you're looking for something in between that you can get for a good price and then turn into your dream-home... I can help you achieve any of those goals.

So that's pretty much what I do. Which of those three things caught your attention the most?
